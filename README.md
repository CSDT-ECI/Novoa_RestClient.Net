### Why You Should Use It ###

* Treats Urls as first class citizens. Urls are immutable [records](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/tutorials/records) and have a fluent API for construction.
* Designed for Dependency Injection. Mock your REST calls and add RestClient.Net to your IoC container with one line of code
* Async friendly. All operations use async, await keywords
* Automatic request/response body serialization to/from strong types (JSON, Binary, SOAP, [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers))
* Install from NuGet on any platform from .NET Framework 4.5 up to .NET 5. Supports Xamarin (Mono, iOS, Android), UWP, [WebAssembly](https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/RestClient.Net/wiki/Web-Assembly-Support) and Unity with .NET Standard 2.0
* Supports GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE with ability and custom methods
* Tight code (around 350 lines) means you can make a change if you need to
